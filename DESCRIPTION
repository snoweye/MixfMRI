Description: Utilizing model-based clustering (unsupervised)
        for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.
        The developed methods (Chen and Maitra (2023) <doi:10.1002/hbm.26425>)
        include 2D and 3D clustering analyses
        (for p-values with voxel locations) and
        segmentation analyses (for p-values alone) for fMRI data where p-values
        indicate significant level of activation responding to stimulate
        of interesting. The analyses are mainly identifying active
        voxel/signal associated with normal brain behaviors.
        Analysis pipelines (R scripts) utilizing this package
        (see examples in 'inst/workflow/') is also implemented with high
        performance techniques.
