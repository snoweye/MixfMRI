Description: Utilizing model-based clustering (unsupervised)
        for fMRI data especially in a distributed manner. The methods
        includes 2D and 3D clustering analyses and segmentation analyses for
        fMRI signals where p-values are significant levels of active voxels
        which respond to stimulate of interesting. The analyses are
        mainly identifying active voxels/signals from normal brain behaviors.
        Workflows are also implemented utilizing high performance techniques.
