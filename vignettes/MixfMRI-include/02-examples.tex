The examples presented below may not be real nor represent any meaningful
brain activity. However, the purpose is to assess the performance
of our proposed clustering methodology when any signal detected from
voxels which can be active in vary ways.


\subsection[2D Phantoms]{2D Phantoms}
\label{sec:phantoms}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\thesubsection. 2D Phantoms}

Three 2D phantoms built in the \pkg{MixfMRI} can be plotted in \proglang{R}
from the demo as simple as
\begin{Code}[title=Maitra's Phantoms]
R> demo(maitra_phantom, package = "MixfMRI", ask = F)
\end{Code}
which performs the code in \code{MixfMRI/demo/maitra_phantom.r}.
The \proglang{R}
command should give a plot similar with Figure~\ref{fig:maitra_phantom}
containing three 2D slices of a brain.
Each phantom may have different amounts of
activated voxels (in terms of small p-values).
Colors represent different activations
such as distributions of p-values that can be computed by hypothesis testing
of prespecified statistical models associated with experiments designed
to discover brain functions responding to prespecified stimula.
The total proportions of active voxels are listed in the title of
each phantom.
\begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig:maitra_phantom}
\end{figure}

The examples used below mimic some active regions (in 2D)
depending on different types of stimula that may trigger responses
in the brain.
Hypothetically, the voxels may be active by regions, but
each region may not be active in the same way (or magnitude) even they may need
to collectively respone to the stimula (e.g. due to time delay,
responding orders, or sensitivity of study deisgns).

For example, only 3.968\% of voxels in the \code{shepp2fMRI} phantom are active
and indicate by two different colors (light blue and light brown)
for different activation where p-values may be smaller than 0.05
and may follow two Beta distributions (with different configurations)
for active voxles and one uniform distribution (i.e. $Beta(1, 1)$)
for inactive voxels.

The following code provides some counts for each groups of active and
inactive voxels in the \code{shepp2fMRI} phantom.
\begin{CodeOutput}[title=Summary of shepp2fMRI Phantoms]
> table(shepp2fMRI, useNA="always")
shepp2fMRI
    0     1     2  <NA> 
13408   472    82 51574 
\end{CodeOutput}
The summary says that this phantom has three kinds of activations
with group ids: 0, 1, and 2.
There are 13,408 voxels belonging to cluster 0 (inactive),
followed by 472 voxels belonging to cluster 1 (active \& high lighted in
light blue in Figure~\ref{fig:maitra_phantom}), and
82 voxels belonging to cluster 2 (active \& high lighted in
light brown in Figure~\ref{fig:maitra_phantom}).
There are 51,574 pixels (NA) of this
imaging dataset which are not within the brain (contour by the black line
in Figure~\ref{fig:maitra_phantom}).
See Section~\ref{sec:2d_simulations} for information of generating
p-values from a mixture of three Beta distributions.


\subsection[2D Simulations]{2D Simulations}
\label{sec:2d_simulations}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\thesubsection. 2D Simulations}

The \pkg{MixfMRI} provides a function \code{gendataset(phantom, overlap)}
to generate p-values of activations.
The function needs two arguments: \code{phantom} and \code{overlap}.
The \code{phantom} is a map containing voxel group id's
where p-values will be simulated from a mixture Beta distribution with
certain mixture level specified by the \code{overlap} argument.
The example can be found in
\code{MixfMRI/demo/maitra_2d.r} and can be done in \proglang{R}
as simple as
\begin{Code}[title=Simulations of Active Voxels]
R> demo(maitra_2d, package = "MixfMRI", ask = F)
\end{Code}
Note the overlap repesents similarity of activation signals. The higher
the overlap, the more difficult to distinguish the clusters.

The command above should give a plot similar to Figure~\ref{fig:maitra_2d}
containing group id's on the left and their associated
p-values for stimulus responses on the right.
The top row displays examples for phantom \code{shepp1fMRI}, and the
bottom row displays examples for phantom \code{shepp2fMRI}.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Inside the brain,
the group id 2's are indicated by white (active is highly associated with
stimula due to experiment design),
1's are indicated by light gray (slightly active),
and 0's are indicated by dark gray (inactive).
Note the white color was light blue
and the light gray was light brown in Figure~\ref{fig:maitra_phantom}
\item
The simulated p-values are colored by red-orange-yellow from 0 to 1.
Note that small p-values (red) may also occur at inactive voxels.
\end{itemize}
See Figure~\ref{fig:maitra_2d_fclust} for the distribution of
simulated p-values for the phantom \code{shepp2fMRI}.

\end{figure}

The methodology and analyses developed in this package are aiming for
identifying those active voxels in spatial clusters. For example,
regions of active voxels associated with playing certain sports.
When an experiment was conducted/designed to detect brain behaviors,
the statistical model and the p-values of the treatment effect
should be able to reflact the voxel activations.
Typically, the statistical tests are done independently voxel by voxel
due to complexity of computation and modeling.
This package provides post hoc clustering that adds spatial contents
to p-vlaues and helps to isolate meaningful regions
clouded with many small p-values.
See \cite{ChenMaitra2018} for information of clustering performance and
comprehensive assessments for this post hoc approach.


\subsection[2D Clustering]{2D Clustering}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\thesubsection. 2D Clustering}

The example can be found in
\code{MixfMRI/demo/maitra_2d_fclust.r} as simple as
\begin{Code}[title=Clustering of Active Voxels]
R> demo(maitra_2d_fclust, package = "MixfMRI", ask = F)
\end{Code}
This demo (explained below) is to cluster the simulated p-values
(see Section~\ref{sec:2d_simulations}) using the developed method.
\begin{Code}[title=Code of \code{maitra\_2d\_fclust.r}]
library(MixfMRI, quietly = TRUE)
set.seed(1234)
da <- gendataset(phantom = shepp2fMRI, overlap = 0.01)$pval

### Check 2d data.
id <- !is.na(da)
PV.gbd <- da[id]
# pdf(file = "maitra_2d_fclust.pdf", width = 6, height = 4)
hist(PV.gbd, nclass = 100, main = "p-value")
# dev.off()

### Test 2d data.
id.loc <- which(id, arr.ind = TRUE)
X.gbd <- t(t(id.loc) / dim(da))
ret <- fclust(X.gbd, PV.gbd, K = 3)
print(ret)

### Check performance
library(EMCluster, quietly = TRUE)
RRand(ret$class, shepp2fMRI[id] + 1)
\end{Code}
In the code above, the histogram of simulated p-values is plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:maitra_2d_fclust}.
Then, the
\code{fclust(X.gbd, PV.gbd, K = 3)} groups voxels in three clusters.
At the end, \code{ret} saves the clustering results.
The \code{print(ret)} from the above code will show the results below
in detail:
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{N} is the total number of voxels to be clustered.
\item \code{K} is the total number of clusters.
\item \code{n.class} is the number of voxels for each cluster.
\item \code{ETA} is the mixing proportion of each cluster.
\item \code{BETA} is the parameters of Beta distributions (by column).
\item \code{MU} is the centers of clusters (location within the brain).
\item \code{SIGMA} is the dispersion of clusters.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Activation (p-values) Distribution. The x-axis is for the p-values.}
\centering
\vspace{0.2cm}
\includegraphics[width=6in]{./MixfMRI-include/maitra_2d_fclust}
\label{fig:maitra_2d_fclust}
\end{figure}

The numbers of voxels for each cluster are
13,394, 184, and 384 associated with new cluster ids: 0, 1, and 2,
respectivelly.
Comparing with the true classifications (see the table in
Section~\ref{sec:phantoms}), the adjusted Rand index gives
$0.9749$ indicating good consistence between true active and clustered results.
